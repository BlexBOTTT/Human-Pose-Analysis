# Human Pose Analysis (still kinda wip description)

Human Pose Analysis is a project aimed at estimating the spatial locations of key body joints or landmarks in a human body, typically in 2D or 3D space. This is achieved through computer vision techniques, allowing the interpretation of various poses made by humans through imagery and live camera feeds.

## Main Files

The repository contains three main Jupyter Notebook files for different aspects of human pose analysis:

1. **main_image.ipynb**: This notebook performs human pose analysis on still images.
2. **main_video.ipynb**: This notebook analyzes human poses in sample videos of people performing different poses.
3. **main_live.ipynb**: This notebook provides live feed analysis of human poses through a camera.

## Dependencies

The code relies on the following libraries and dependencies:

- OpenCV: Computer vision library used for image and video processing.
- TensorFlow: Deep learning framework used for human pose estimation.
- Other necessary Python libraries. You can install them using `pip` or `conda`.

To install the required dependencies, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless tensorflow
```
