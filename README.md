STILL IN WORK IN PROGRESS!!!!

Human pose estimation is the process of determining the spatial locations of key body joints or landmarks in a human body, typically in a 2D or 3D space. Basically the computer interpreting various poses made by humans via an imagery, or at some cases a live camera feed.

Can be used for
- computer vision
- robotics (and its movements)
- human to computer interaction
